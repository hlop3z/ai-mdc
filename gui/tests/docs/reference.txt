## 7. Conclusion

This enhanced solution effectively integrates AI prompts, business rules, and user-defined templates entirely within a modular and persistent database-driven platform. By leveraging Gradio for a rapid and intuitive UI, Ollama for powerful LLM interactions, and SQLAlchemy for robust data management, this architecture provides a maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly foundation for future AI-driven chat interface enhancements. Managing rules directly within the database, coupled with the inclusion of a **copy button** for prompt templates, streamlines user workflows and centralizes all configuration within the application's data store.
