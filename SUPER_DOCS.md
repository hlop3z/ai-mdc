# Create Technical Docs

I want you to perform a **deep technical analysis** of the codebase and review all provided documentation. Combine this with your understanding of the project to generate a complete set of **enterprise-grade software development documentation**.

Focus exclusively on the **technical aspects**, and produce documentation tailored to the needs of various technical stakeholders (developers, architects, DevOps, QA, security teams), including:

- âœ… **White papers**
- âœ… **Formal specifications**
- âœ… **Architecture overviews**
- âœ… **Module/interface documentation**
- âœ… **API references**
- âœ… **Build & deployment guides**
- âœ… **Security/performance notes**
- âœ… **Roadmap**

> ðŸ§­ Follow widely accepted documentation frameworks and standards such as:
>
> - **DiÃ¡taxis Framework** (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation)
> - **ISO/IEC 26514**
> - **Sphinx / reStructuredText**
> - **OpenAPI / AsyncAPI (for APIs)**
> - **PlantUML / Mermaid** (for diagrams)

The goal is to deliver a **clear, consistent, and comprehensive technical documentation suite** that supports maintainability, onboarding, and scalability at an enterprise level.
