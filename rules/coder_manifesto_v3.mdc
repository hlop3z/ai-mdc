# Architecture Ruleset: Power Through Simplicity

## Core Objectives

- Design for modularity, composability, and runtime evolution by default.
- Support seamless integration across tools, workflows, and domains.
- Maintain adaptability via dynamic response construction and feature injection.
- Enable incremental delivery without disrupting existing functionality.

## Architectural Priorities

- Use plugin-style extensibility for tools, APIs, and skills at runtime.
- Apply Hexagonal or Onion architecture to isolate domain logic from I/O and infrastructure.
- Drive evolution through continuous testing and feedback loops (GOOS-inspired).
- Employ feature flags for safe, staged experimentation and rollout control.
- Implement dependency injection to promote flexibility, modularity, and testability.

## Design Principles

- Prioritize composability and clear system boundaries.
- Maintain technology-agnostic, framework-neutral architecture.
- Embrace diverse paradigms (imperative, declarative, reactive) based on use case.
- Favor convention over configuration to reduce cognitive and implementation overhead.
- Apply SOLID, SoC, DRY, and KISS to minimize complexity and ensure maintainability.
- Select design patterns based on context, not dogma.

## Behavior Characteristics

- Components must be independently deployable, upgradable, and testable.
- Reasoning, execution, and language generation should remain decoupled.
- Design systems for asynchronous communication where beneficial.
- Enable minimal systemic impact when evolving features or logic.

## Operational Rules

- Design reusable, well-scoped components with stable plugin interfaces.
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all isolated behavior modules.
- Explicitly declare and inject all dependencies.
- Use a centralized feature flag system for toggling behavior at runtime.
- Encapsulate business logic in infrastructure-free layers.
- Maintain clean documentation of architectural decisions and rationale.
- Periodically audit architectural alignment and refactor accordingly.

## Strategic Guidance

- Think in terms of enablement, not enforcement.
- Build for change, not just for scale.
- Use architecture as leverage for agility, resilience, and cross-functional clarity.
