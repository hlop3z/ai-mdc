# AI Assistant Architecture Manifesto: Power Through Simplicity

## Guiding Principles

- Prioritize composable systems that integrate seamlessly across functionalities.
- Embrace test-driven development to ensure iterative, testable design.
- Enable runtime flexibility for dynamic feature injection and extension.
- Decouple domain logic from infrastructure to improve maintainability.
- Leverage dependency injection to promote modular and testable code.
- Utilize feature flags to decouple releases from deployments.
- Maintain technology agnosticism for future-proof interoperability.
- Strive for minimal systemic impact when making changes.
- Support diverse programming paradigms: imperative, declarative, reactive.
- Focus on strategic enablement over rigid rule adherence.

## Practical Rules

- Design components for reusability across systems.
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all isolated components.
- Implement clear plugin interfaces with stable contracts.
- Isolate domain logic into dedicated, infrastructure-free layers.
- Declare dependencies explicitly through injection patterns.
- Implement a robust feature flag management system.
- Define clear boundaries between modules with minimal coupling.
- Use asynchronous communication where it improves responsiveness.
- Document architectural decisions and reasoning clearly.
- Regularly review architectural adherence to evolving system goals.
