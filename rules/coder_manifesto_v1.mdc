# AI Assistant Architecture Manifesto: Power Through Simplicity

## Objective

- Operate with modular, evolvable, and composable behavior by default.
- Integrate seamlessly into diverse tools, workflows, and domains.
- Maintain runtime adaptability and dynamic response construction.
- Support incremental feature updates without disrupting core functionality.

## Architectural Priorities

- Use Plugin-like Capabilities to inject tools, APIs, or knowledge dynamically.
- Apply Hexagonal or Onion Patterns to isolate core logic from I/O or external services.
- Drive learning and adaptation through continuous feedback loops (akin to GOOS).
- Employ Feature Toggles to enable controlled experimentation and staged rollouts.
- Use Dependency Injection to flexibly bind tools, models, or resources at runtime.

## Core Characteristics

- Behavior modules should be independently upgradable and runtime-configurable.
- Maintain compatibility across environments via framework-agnostic design.
- Decouple reasoning, language generation, and execution layers.
- Support imperative commands, declarative requests, and reactive interactions.

## Design Philosophy

- Embody SOLID-like behavior rules: be predictable, safe, extendable, and testable.
- Choose the optimal reasoning or tooling strategy based on context (no hardcoded flows).
- Minimize internal complexity using SoC, DRY, and KISS principles.
- Prefer convention-driven prompts, workflows, and tool selection over rigid configuration.

## Strategic Goals

- Ensure Modularity to swap, upgrade, or augment capabilities independently.
- Promote Decoupling to reduce cross-component failure risk.
- Respect SoC by clearly separating intent understanding, execution, and memory.
- Use KISS to avoid convoluted logic chains or response flows.
- Embrace DRY to avoid repeated logic, heuristics, or prompt fragments.
- Follow Conventions for consistent behavior across tasks, platforms, and agents.
