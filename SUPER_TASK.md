# 📄 Task Documentation Types

## ✨ When to Use What

### ✅ Use a **Ticket Tracker** (e.g., Jira, Linear) if

- You're part of a sprint-driven team.
- You need structured status updates, assignees, and workflow visibility.
- You want tight integration with project boards and dev tools.

### 📝 Use a **Notion Task** if

- You're working solo or in a lightweight team.
- You want to embed tasks directly in documentation (e.g., design specs, architecture notes).
- You prefer a research-oriented, context-rich format.
