# üß© Task: Full Technical Inventory & Architectural Retrospective

We are initiating a **deep-dive technical audit** of the current project to prepare for a clean, future-proof rebuild. The objective is to extract **knowledge, patterns, and reusable concepts** ‚Äî not code.

---

## ‚úÖ Scope of Work

### 1. **Full Inventory Report**

- List **all external/vendor libraries**, with:

  - Version used
  - Purpose in the project
  - Any known issues or limitations
  - Recommendation: Keep / Replace / Remove

- List **all internal core elements**:

  - Key functions, structs, components, or modules
  - Their responsibilities and how they interact
  - Which architectural layer they belong to

### 2. **Architectural Patterns & Concepts**

- Identify all **architectural patterns** used (e.g., Hexagonal Architecture, Clean Architecture, CQRS, Singleton, Factory, Adapter, etc.)
- For each pattern:

  - Where it is applied
  - Why it was chosen
  - How effective it was
  - Recommendation: Retain / Improve / Replace

### 3. **Terminology & Industry Standards**

- Extract all domain-specific and architectural terms used (e.g., "orchestrator", "adapter", "port", "controller", "boundary", "entity", etc.)
- Include definitions and context of use
- Validate against current industry best practices

### 4. **Retrospective Learnings**

- Document what worked well and what didn‚Äôt
- Highlight **mistakes or architectural pitfalls**
- If a better way has been discovered, **document the improved approach**

### 5. **Update & Improvement Recommendations**

- Research and include recommendations for:

  - Updated or alternative libraries
  - Improved architectural patterns or practices
  - Performance and maintainability enhancements
